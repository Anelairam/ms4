## Design

### Inspiration:

My current working occupation in restaurants and the interest in management systems were my main motivation for creating the web application. The idea was to create a fully functioning web application for customers and business owner in order to have an automated system for reservations, bookings and the manipulation of them.

### Font

The Font selection decided for the web application using google fonts, the font in use is the Oooh Baby which is designed by Robert Leuschkewas.
The font implements a playful touch in the web application combined with the background the brings thoughts of creativity from the food perspective.


### Icons

The icons used where from font awesome as there the most reliable and helpful.

### Responsive

**Anything more?**

Yes! We'd strongly encourage you to look at the source code of the `uptime.sh` file so that you know what it's doing. As future software developers, it will be great practice to see how these shell scripts work.

Happy coding!
